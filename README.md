# Retail-Analytics-Dashboard 
## Project Overview
This project is a **Retail Sales & Revenue Analytics Dashboard** built for a mid-sized Canadian retail chain. The goal of the project is to provide actionable insights into sales performance, inventory management, and revenue trends, enabling data-driven business decisions. 

This is an **end-to-end Business Intelligence project**, demonstrating skills in SQL, Power BI, Excel, and data analysis.

## Business Problem
The retail chain faced the following challenges:
- Declining sales in certain stores and categories  
- Inconsistent revenue across regions  
- Poor inventory management and shrinkage  
- Lack of visibility on key KPIs and performance trends  

This project solves these problems by creating an integrated data pipeline, performing analysis, and visualizing insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Dataset
The project uses 4 main datasets (all generated synthetically for portfolio purposes):

| Dataset | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sales.csv` | Daily sales transactions including store, product, units sold, price, discount, and revenue |
| `products.csv` | Product details including category, subcategory, brand, and cost |
| `stores.csv` | Store information including location, region, store size, and manager |
| `inventory.csv` | Inventory levels for each product and store, including opening stock, closing stock, and shrinkage |
